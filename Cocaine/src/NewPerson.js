lvlThreeConvoOne.modules.push([
							"So are you just not a fan of fantasy in general?",

							"No magic for you?",
							"No, I'm still definitely a fan of magic, but I prefer fantasy stories that have a more contemporary context, like Harry Potter.",
							"I guess someone's family got killed by wizards or something, geez..."

/* Conversation Two */
lvlThreeConvoTwo.modules.push([
							"Also, no offense, but your apartment's kind of a wreck right now dude.",

lvlThreeConvoTwo.modules.push([
							"I'm just worried, man. It could be a potential health hazard.",

							"You could get sick or something.",
							"Yeah? If I remember correctly, didn't we find a month old meat-lover's pizza at your place last year? Would you consider that healthy?",
							"Hey, I'm just trying to help. Peace."

lvlThreeConvoTwo.modules.push([
							"It's cause you left it there, dude!",
							"Alright, alright, point made. I should be more free this weekend, so I'll set aside some time to do some damage control on my apartment.",

lvlThreeConvoThree.modules.push([
							"I'm thinking something spicy, but not something that will make me sick.",

/* Conversation Four */
lvlThreeConvoFour.modules.push([
							"Okay really though, Star Wars or Star Trek?",
							"I dunno; I'll be honest, I haven't really been a huge fan of either of the two series. I've enjoyed watching both of them, though.",
							"You've gotta pick a side on this one.",
							"Seriously dude, I can't say that I prefer one over the other. They both just seem to similar to me to make an informed decision between the two.",
							"Typical, always avoiding the important questions."
							]);
							
lvlThreeConvoFour.modules.push([
							"Seriously? You can't just pick one of them and be done with it?",
							"I dunno, I really don't feel right about not making an informed decision about this. Plus, if someone asks me why I chose one over the other I don't want to have to defend myself",
							"Just flip a coin if you want.",
							"I mean I could, but I really don't want to be dishonest and pick a series I don't care about. Plus, I don't want people asking me to defend my decision.",
							"Man, you really are no fun."
							]);

lvlThreeConvoFour.modules.push([
							"Eh, I guess that makes sense, but hypothetically who would you choose?",
							"Eh, the recent Star Trek reboot movies definitely win the contest for best special effects, so I think I'll go with them.",
							"Like, if your life was on the line?",
							"I can't imagine a situation like that happening, but probably Star Trek cause the new movies are so good-looking.",
